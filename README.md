# Broadsheet

Broadsheet is a news reader that does less for you and knows less about you. If you're sick of modern software, you might like it.

#### ðŸ‘‰ No recommendations
Add sources without harassment from a shitty "recommendation engine". Broadsheet doesn't monitor or analyze your reading habits.

#### ðŸ‘‰ No social media integration
No one cares that you read an article. It's how social media sites target you with interest-based ads and build up demographic data to sell to marketers.

#### ðŸ‘‰ No Pocket/Instapaper/Evernote integration
News is ephemeral - if it's important, you'll remember. No need to tell another company what you like to read.

#### ðŸ‘‰ No user tracking or analytics
Broadsheet doesn't track your behaviour. It doesn't matter how many times you click a link or whatever dumb metric marketers care about.

### Privacy

Broadsheet needs an email address from you. This is used for password resets in the event you get locked out.

Any feeds you subscribe to will be tied to your email address. If you're concerned about Broadsheet knowing your interests, it would be wise to use a "junk" email address that has no personal information in it (a good idea for any website, really).

## Installation

Broadsheet requires node.js and mongodb. You'll need to configure some environment variables before running it.

Environment variables are listed in `.example.env` - you can either duplicate that file, rename it to `.env` and configure values there, or just set them on your own.

Once you're set up, run `npm i && npm start` from the project root to get started.
